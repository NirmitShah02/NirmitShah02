An inquisitive student who is eager to seek opportunities and learn new things. Always ready to take up challenging tasks and implement solutions based on proper analysis.

I want to make a significant contribution to the success of the organization by developing productive and result-oriented solutions to solve technical/non-technical challenges. If worked on the lines programming can be the best source of bread and butter one can have which indeed is my goal.
